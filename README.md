##### Note: This Library uses Contacts.framework and hence one needs to provide `NSContactsUsageDescription` in the app's `Info.plist` specifying an appropriate reason.

## Features

* Integrated Contacts Access and Permission Handling.
* Choose between phone number and e-mail address.
* Adaptable UI.

## Usage

To start using the component add it to your project using Carthage or manually as per the [Installation](#installation) section.

The UI component can be used via the `ContactsSuggestionTextField` class. This control can be used very similar to `UITextField` - both from Interface Builder, or from code.

To create an instance of the class, use Interface builder, or do it from code. This example will create a field which shows a short name and email address of a contact:

```swift
let textField = ContactsSuggestionTextField(frame: CGRect(x: 10, y: 10, width: 200, height: 45))

/// customize the textfield.
/// For Interface Builder, an IBOutlet can be created and the customization can be done as illustrated below.
textField.customize = { builder in
    builder.contactNameStyle = .short
    builder.contactType = .emailAddress
}
self.view.addSubview(textField)
```

Do something when the user selects a contact like the following:

```swift
tf.contactSelectedHandler = { [weak self] contact: String in
    // do something with contact
}
```

# Installation

#### CocoaPods
The control is available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/). CocoaPods can be installed using [Ruby gems](https://rubygems.org/):
```shell
$ gem install cocoapods
```

Then simply add `ContactsSuggestionTextField` to your Podfile:

```
pod 'ContactsSuggestionTextField', '~> 0.0.3'
```

Lastly, let CocoaPods fetch the latest version of the component by running:
```shell
$ pod update
```

#### Carthage
The component supports [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage). Start by making sure you have the latest version of Carthage installed. Using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) run this:
```shell
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```
Then add `ContactsSuggestionTextField` to your `Cartfile`:
```
github "paulsumit1993/ContactsSuggestionTextField"
```
Finally, add the framework to the Xcode project of your App. Link the framework to your App and copy it to the App’s Frameworks directory via the “Build Phases” section.

#### Manual

You can download the latest files from our [Releases page](https://github.com/paulsumit1993/ContactsSuggestionTextField/releases). After doing so, copy the files in the `ContactsSuggestionTextField` folder to your project.
